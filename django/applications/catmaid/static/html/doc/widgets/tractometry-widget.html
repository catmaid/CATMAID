<p>Find bundles of similar neurons based on NBLAST similarity result scores.
This widget requires a certain server configuration, see below if you get a
warning when the widget is started.</p>

<h3>Server configuration</h3>

<p>The neuron similarity clustering requires the <em>plpython3u</em> extension
to be installed in the CATMAID database. Since this requires super-user
permissions, it isn't done automatically. If you see a warning when the widget
is loaded, you need to do a brief manual configuration steup.</p>
<p>This requires <em>Python 3</em>to be installed system-wide, along with the
modules <span class="inline-code">numpy</span> and <span class="inline-code">
sklearn</span>. It also requires admins to login to the database, e.g. through
<span class="inline-code">manage.py dbshell</span> and run <span
class="inline-code">CREATE EXTENSION plpython3u;</span> in the CATMAID database.</p>
