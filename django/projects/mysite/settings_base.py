CATMAID supports both Chrome and Firefox as browsers, other browsers
might or might not work. Once the website above is loaded and you see
the CATMAID logo, you can sign-in in the upper right corner, using your
CATMAID username "{{user.username}}" and the password you provided at
the registration.

In the upper right corner there is also a question mark icon, which you
can use to toggle context specific help information to get you started.

You should also see the visible projects listed in the main part of the
page. Clicking on either an image or link will open main viewer at some
central location. Clicking the neuron like structure in the top toolbar
of that viewer will open the Tracing Tool, which gives access to tracing
data and related tools.

Note that by default you will be in a "select" interaction mode, i.e.
you click on neurons in the 2D view, but you won't create and modify
data. If you want to trace neurons or change existing data, you would
need to switch to tracing mode, which you can do by clicking the left
most icon in the second toolbar from the top (the one connecting dots).

All available tools (also referred to as widgets) can be searched and
opened by starting the Open-Widget dialog, either by clicking the first
icon button in the top toolbar, or by pressing Ctrl/Cmd+Space.

Don't hesitate to ask, if you run into problems or have questions and
comments.

Best,
The CATMAID admins
