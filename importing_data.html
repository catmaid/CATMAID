<h1>Exporting and importing Data<a class="headerlink" href="#exporting-and-importing-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>For importing, there are currently two different tool-sets available in CATMAID.
A front-end in Django&#8217;s admin interface is only available for importing project
and stack information. If you want to import tracing data, you have to resort to
the command line.</p>
<div class="section" id="exporting-and-importing-neuron-tracing-data">
<h2>Exporting and importing neuron tracing data<a class="headerlink" href="#exporting-and-importing-neuron-tracing-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Two management commands for Django&#8217;s <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">manage.py</span></code> tool are available in CATMAID
that allow exporting and importing neuron tracing data. They are called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">catmaid_export_data</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">catmaid_import_data</span></code>. To use them, you have to be
in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">virtualenv</span></code> and it is probably easiest to work from the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">django/projects/mysite/</span></code> directory.</p>
<div class="section" id="exporting-data">
<h3>Exporting data<a class="headerlink" href="#exporting-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At the moment, the export command is able to create a JSON representation of
neurons, connectors, tags and annotations. To constrain the exported neurons,
annotations can be used. To export data, you have to use the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">catmaid_export_data</span></code> command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>manage.py catmaid_export_data
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Adding the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--help</span></code> option will show an overview over all available options.
When called without any option, the command will ask the user for the project to
export from and will start exporting the whole project right away. Use the
additional options to be more precise about what should be exported.</p>
<p>Without any parameter, everything is exported. The type of data to be exported
can be adjusted by the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--notreenodes</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--noconnectors</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--noannotations</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--notags</span></code> parameters. To constrain the exported
neurons, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--required-annotation</span></code> option can be used. For instance, to
export all neurons from the project with ID <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></code> that are annotated with
&#8220;Kenyon cells&#8221;, one would have to call:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>manage.py catmaid_export_data --source 1 --required-annotation &quot;Kenyon cells&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will create a file called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">export_pid_1.json</span></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="importing-data">
<h3>Importing data<a class="headerlink" href="#importing-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The JSON file generated in the previous section can be used to import data into
a CATMAID instance. <em>Currently, the importer won&#8217;t change the primary key IDs in
the input data, so be aware of potential data loss if you import into an
instance with existing data.</em> For now, this is only practical to import data
into a new CATMAID instance. To do this, the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">catmaid_import_data</span></code> management
command has to be used:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>manage.py catmaid_import_data
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--help</span></code> switch to get an overview of the available options.
Like the exporter, the importer will ask a user if it needs more information.
Required are currently the source file and a user. The importer does currently
not preserve ownership if the imported models. The user (and editor and
reviewer) is needed to override the information in the source data set.</p>
<p>Assuming a file called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">export_pid_1.json</span></code> is available and a new CATMAID
project with ID <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></code> has been created, the following command will start the
import:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>manage.py catmaid_import_data --source export_pid_1.json --target 1
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The tool will ask for a user to use for all data before it actually starts the
import.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="importing-project-and-stack-information">
<h2>Importing project and stack information<a class="headerlink" href="#importing-project-and-stack-information" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Image data in CATMAID is referenced by stacks. Stacks in turn are
organized in projects. The data used by a stack can have one of
various types of data sources. A simple and often used source is a
simple folder structure of tiled image data for each stack. To be
accessible, a stack&#8217;s image base has to give access to such a folder
from the web. Of course, stacks and projects can be created by hand,
but there is also an importing tool available in Django&#8217;s admin
interface. It can be found under <em>Custom Views</em> and is named
<em>Importer</em>. For now, the importing tool only supports this standard
data source.</p>
<p>Therefore, the importing tool expects a certain data folder layout to
work on and also relies on so called <em>project files</em> (which are very
simple) to identify potential projects. The next section will introduce
the project file format and after that the data layout will be
explained.</p>
<p>How to use the importing tool will be shown in the last section.</p>
<div class="section" id="project-files">
<h3>Project Files<a class="headerlink" href="#project-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If the importing tool encounters a folder with a file called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">project.yaml</span></code> in it, it will look at it as a potential project. If
this file is not available, the folder is ignored. However, if the file
is there it gets parsed and if all information is found the tool is
looking for, the project can be imported. So let&#8217;s assume we have a
project with two stacks stored in folder with the following layout:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>project1/
  project.yaml
  stack1/
  stack2/
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A project file contains the basic properties of a project and its
associated stacks. It is a simple <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a>
file and could look like this for the example above:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>project:
    name: &quot;Wing Disc 1&quot;
    stacks:
      - folder: &quot;stack1&quot;
        name: &quot;Channel 1&quot;
        metadata: &quot;PMT Offset: 10, Laser Power: 0.5, PMT Voltage: 550&quot;
        dimension: &quot;(3886,3893,55)&quot;
        resolution: &quot;(138.0,138.0,1.0)&quot;
        zoomlevels: 2
        fileextension: &quot;jpg&quot;
        overlays:
          - name: &quot;Channel 2 overlay&quot;
            folder: &quot;stack2&quot;
            defaultopacity: 0.5
            fileextension: &quot;jpg&quot;
          - name: &quot;Remote overlay&quot;
            url: &quot;http://my.other.server.net/overlaystack/&quot;
            fileextension: &quot;jpg&quot;
      - folder: &quot;stack2&quot;
        name: &quot;Channel 2&quot;
        metadata: &quot;PMT Offset: 10, Laser Power: 0.7, PMT Voltage: 500&quot;
        dimension: &quot;(3886,3893,55)&quot;
        resolution: &quot;(138.0,138.0,1.0)&quot;
        zoomlevels: 2
        fileextension: &quot;jpg&quot;
      - url: &quot;http://my.other.server.net/examplestack/&quot;
        name: &quot;Remote stack&quot;
        dimension: &quot;(3886,3893,55)&quot;
        resolution: &quot;(138.0,138.0,1.0)&quot;
        zoomlevels: 3
        fileextension: &quot;png&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As can be seen, a project has only two properties: a name and a set of
stacks. A stack, however, needs more information. In general, there are
two ways to specify the data source for a folder: 1. a folder, than can
be read relative to the project file and 2. a URL which is used as is
as a stack&#8217;s image base.</p>
<p>The first stack in the example above is based on a folder in the same
directory as the project file. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">folder</span></code> property names this image
data folder for this stack, relative to the project file. The name of
stack is stored in the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name</span></code> field and metadata (which is shown when
a stack is displayed) can be added with the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">metadata</span></code> property. A
stack also needs <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dimensions</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">resolution</span></code> information.
Dimensions are the stacks X, Y and Z extent in <em>pixel</em>. The resolution
should be in in <em>nanometers per pixel</em>, in X, Y and Z.</p>
<p>Additionally to the folder information, the second stack above uses the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">zoomlevels</span></code> setting to declare the number of zoom levels. It also
specifies the file extension of the image files with the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fileextension</span></code> setting. If these settings are not used, the importer
will look at the folder to find out the information on its own. Such a
search is only started if one of those settings is missing and only a
missing setting is set to the values found. These settings can therefore
be used to have more explicit project files, avoid file system look-ups
or to use custom values (e.g. to only use two of four zoom levels).</p>
<p>The last stack in the example above <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> use a local stack folder,
but declares the stack&#8217;s image base explicitly by using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">url</span></code>
setting. This setting <em>requires</em> to also use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">zoomlevel</span></code> and the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fileextension</span></code> fields, because the importer won&#8217;t try different URLs
to get an idea about the file extension and the number of zoom levels.
Like done for the folder based stacks, a url based stack needs the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">resolution</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dimension</span></code> fields, too.</p>
<p>A stack can also have <em>overlays</em>. To add one or more of them, please
use the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">overlays</span></code> field in a stack. Like visible in the example, an
overlay needs at least a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">name</span></code> and a data source, which can be
either <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">folder</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">url</span></code> based. The implications of using one or
the other are similar to the ones for stacks: When using a URL, a
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fileextension</span></code> field needs to be present, but zoom level information
is not needed for overlays. For folder based overlays, you can, but
don&#8217;t need to, provide a <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">fileextension</span></code>. If you don&#8217;t, the import
tries to find it on its own. Besides that, a default opacity for
displaying an overlay can be provided, by using the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">defaultopacity</span></code>
key word. It ranges from zero to one. If not provided, it defaults to zero.</p>
<p>Also, it wouldn&#8217;t confuse the tool if there is more YAML data in the
project file than needed. It only uses what is depicted in the sample
above. But please keep in mind to <em>not use the tab character</em> in the
whitespace indentation (but simple spaces) as this isn&#8217;t allowed in
YAML.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="file-and-folder-layout">
<h3>File and Folder Layout<a class="headerlink" href="#file-and-folder-layout" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The importing tool expects a certain file any folder layout to work with.
It assumes that there is one data folder per CATMAID instance that is
accessible from the outside world and is somehow referred to within
a stack&#8217;s image base (if referring to folders in the project file). As
an example, let&#8217;s say a link named <em>data</em> has been placed in CATMAID&#8217;s
httpdocs directory. This link links to your actual data storage and has
a layout like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>data/
  project1/
  project2/
  project3/
  tests/
    project4/
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each project folder has contents similar to the example in the previous
section. Due to having placed the link in the httpdocs directory it is
already accessible under (if your webserver user has reading permissions
on it):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>http://&lt;CATMAID-URL&gt;/data
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A typical URL to a tile of a stack could then look like this (if you
use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">jpeg</span></code> as the file extension):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>http://&lt;CATMAID-URL&gt;/data/project1/stack1/0/0_0_0.jpeg
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The importer uses this data directory or a folder below it as working
directory. In this folder it treats every sub-directory as a potential
project directory and tests if it contains a project file named
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">project.yaml</span></code>. If this file is found a folder remains potential
project. A folder is ignored, though, when the project file is not
available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-the-importer">
<h3>Using the Importer<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-importer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To use the importer, you have to adjust your CATMAID settings file to
make your data path and its URL known. These settings are called
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CATMAID_IMPORT_PATH</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CATMAID_IMPORT_URL</span></code>. Sticking to the
examples from before, these variables might be:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>CATMAID_IMPORT_PATH = &lt;CATMAID-PATH&gt;/httpdocs/data
CATMAID_IMPORT_URL = http://&lt;CATMAID-URL&gt;/data
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With this in place, the importer can be used through Django&#8217;s admin
interface. It is listed as <em>Importer</em> under <em>Custom Views</em>. The first
step is to give the importer more detail about which folders to look
in for potential projects:</p>
<img alt="_images/path_setup.png" src="_images/path_setup.png" />
<p>With these settings, you can narrow down the set of folders looked at.
The relative path setting can be used to specify a sub-directory below
the import path. When doing so, the working directory will be changed
to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CATMAID_IMPORT_PATH</span></code> plus the <em>relative path</em>. If left empty, just
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CATMAID_IMPORT_PATH</span></code> setting will be used. Additionally, you
can <em>filter folders</em> in tho working directory by specifying a filter
term. You can use Unix shell-style wildcards there. With the check-box
below this setting, you can make sure the tool looks only at unknown
projects. Here, a project is unknown if all of its stacks are known to
CATMAID. A stack in turn is known if there is already a stack with the
same image base. The last setting on this dialog is the <em>Base URL</em>. By
default it is set to the value of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">CATMAID_IMPORT_URL</span></code> (if available).
This setting plus the relative path stay the same for every project
to be imported in this run. To continue, click on the <em>next step</em>
button.</p>
<p>The importer will tell you if it doesn&#8217;t find any projects based on
the settings of the first step. However, if it does find potential
projects, it allows you to unselect projects that shouldn&#8217;t get
imported and to add more details:</p>
<img alt="_images/project_setup.png" src="_images/project_setup.png" />
<p>Besides deciding which projects to actually import, you can also add
tags which will be attached to the new projects. If the tile size
differs from the standard, it can be adjusted here. If you want your
projects to be accessible publicly, you can mark the corresponding
check-box.</p>
<p>When the <em>Check classification links</em> option is selected, the importer
tries to suggest existing classification graphs to be linked to the
new project(s). These suggestions are optional and based on the tags
you entered before. If existing projects have the same tags or a super
set of it, their linked classification graphs will be suggested.</p>
<p>The last adjustment to make are permissions. With the help
of a list box you can select one or more group/permission combinations
that the new projects will be assigned. If all is how you want it,
you can proceed to the next dialog.</p>
<p>The third and last step is a confirmation where all the information
is shown the importer found about the projects and stacks to be
imported. To change things in this import, simply go back to a step
before, using the buttons at the bottom of the page. If all the
project and stack properties as well as the tags and permissions are
correct, the actual import can start.</p>
<p>In the end the importer will tell you which projects have been
imported and, if there were problems, which ones not.</p>
